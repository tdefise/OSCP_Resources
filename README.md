# Introduction

This is a repository made of multiple cheats in order to perform penetration testing/red team exercice.

I created this repository in order to share all the stuff I'm gathering on the Internet.

I'm not, and I have never worked in an offensive position. However, as mainly working as a Blue Teamer, it is essential for me to have the "Think as an attacker" mindset.

### Resources

#### Standards

Within my documents, I tries to link most of the techniques towards well-known standards.
By using well-known standards, it enable to be able to speak the same language between people.
Those two standards also explains the techniques more in depth, so if you want to go deeper, don't hesitate to follow the links and go more into details.
They also explains how to detect and/or mitigate the techniques we try to use to compromise a system, which is uselfull when writting the report.

- [The Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/) is a comprehensive guide to testing the security of web applications and web services.
- [MITRE ATT&CKÂ®](https://attack.mitre.org/) is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

#### Books

I read books in order to get additional informations from what was available on the Internet.
Even if some of those books are a bit *old*, they are still valuable today.
Here are some reasons:

- You will always fall down on old systems within engagements.
- Sometimes the writter created some tools or give some scripts which are very know
- ..

However, test the tools as well as the options, as their will be things that may have changed.

|Book|Writter|Published|Description|

|[The Hacker Playbook 3: Practical Guide To Penetration Testing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40028366-the-hacker-playbook-3) | Peter Kim | 2018 | It may looks like there is *only* around 250 pages but this book is a good very resource, as it has been published in 2018, there are new tools that were not there in well-known referenced books of early 2010s.<br><br> Note that I started with the number 3 of this series thinking that it was always adding new stuff on top of previous version which is not the case.|
